# Objective

I developed an ArcSIE model of soil components for the MLRA project "MLRA 111B - Glynwood B-slope Erosion; Northeastern IN". This is a FY2017 project from 11-FIN with an extensive number of soil observations. Initially, Neil Martin developed an ArcSIE model to differentiate erosion classes. An analysis of the confusion matrix showed the initial model tended to over predict severely eroded components. I hope to improve upon the initial results.


# Methods

## Geodata

For this project a 10-meter LiDAR DEM from the USGS was used. The original mosaic was subset to 1000x1000 within Grant County, IN. A tabular and graphical summary of the variables is provided below.

```{r geodata}

vars <- data.frame(
  variables        = c("slope gradient", "profile curvature", "tangential curvature", "height above streams", "valley bottom flatness index"),
  abbreviations    = c("slp", "kp", "kt", "mrvbf", "z2st"),
  'resolution (m)' = c(rep(10, 3), rep(30, 2)),
  'window size (cells)'     = c(5, 5, 5, 3, NA),
  check.names = FALSE
  )
kable(vars)

fd <- "D:/geodata/project_data/R11-FIN/glynwood/"
ec <- c("dem_slp", "dem_kp", "dem_kt", "dem_z2st", "dem_mrvbf")
fp <- paste0(fd, ec, "/w001001.adf")
rs <- stack(fp)
names(rs) <- vars$abbreviations

plot(rs)
```

## Component data

Below is a summary of the component geomorphic data populated for the project. The table shows that the concept for where components exist on the landscape differs between end and ground moraines. For example, on end moraines Glynwood is found on the summits, versus on ground moraines Blount is found on the summits.

```{r component data}

prj  <- get_projectmapunit_from_LIMS("MLRA 111B - Glynwood B-slope Erosion; Northeastern IN")
comp <- get_component_from_LIMS("MLRA 111B - Glynwood B-slope Erosion; Northeastern IN") 

comp$erocl <- factor(comp$erocl, levels = 1:3, labels = c("slight", "moderage", "severe"))

coiid <- c(2465787, 2465786, 2465789, 2399714, 2399713, 2399715, 2399709, 2399705)
vars <- c("coiid", "compname", "erocl", "landform", "geompos", "slopeshape", "hillslopeprof")
sub <- comp[comp$coiid %in% coiid, vars]
sub <- with(sub, sub[order(compname, erocl, landform), ])
kable(sub)
# View(sub)
```

## Block diagram

![Below is an example block diagram from [Grant County, IN.](https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/ncss_block_diagrams/IN-2012-01-19-23.png)](C:/Users/stephen.roecker/ownCloud/projects/201711FIN001_Glynwood/block_diagram.png)


## Pedon data

Within the projects 1000x1000 footprint, 46 pedons were available for validation. Below is a summary of the intersection between the site coordinates and environmental covariates. These values will be used as inputs for the ArcSIE v and w parameters. Two instances were developed for each component, since the site and component data support different relationships on end and ground moraines. For all variables, except mrvbf, bell shaped membership functions were used. For mrvbf z-shaped curves were used on end moraines, and s-shaped on ground moraines. Lastly the limiting factor integrator operator was used for all components.


```{r instance values}

ownCloud <- "C:/Users/stephen.roecker/ownCloud/projects/201711FIN001_Glynwood/"
geodata <- "M:/geodata/"
fd <- paste0(geodata, "project_data/11FIN/")

load(paste0(ownCloud, "glynwood_geodata.RData"))

gw$taxonname4 <- paste0(gw$taxonname3, "-", gw$landform)
gw <- subset(gw, !grepl("-NA", taxonname4))

vars <- c("slope5", "kt5", "kp5", "z2streams", "wetness2", "mvalley")
test <- reshape(gw[c("taxonname4", vars)],
                direction = "long",
                timevar = "variable", times = vars,
                v.names = "value", varying = vars
                )
vars <- c("taxonname4", "variable")
test2 <- {
  split(test, test[, vars], drop = TRUE) ->.;
  lapply(., function(x){ data.frame(
    x[1, vars],
    p25 = round(quantile(x$value, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    p50 = round(quantile(x$value, 0.5,  na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    p75 = round(quantile(x$value, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  )}) ->.;
  do.call("rbind", .) ->.;
  rownames(.) <- 1:nrow(.)
  . ->.;
  }

datatable(test2)
# View(test2)
```

By examining we can see overall patterns in the intersection between the site coordinates and spatial layers. For example, the differences between the end and ground moraines are readily apparent. Overall the end moraines have slightly steeper and more convex slopes. Examining trends amongst the erosion classes also shows that the severely eroded classes were also generally steeper and more convex, but not always. In the case of Glynwood severely eroded component phase, the relationship was reversed on end vs ground moraines for profile curvature.

```{r boxplot}
idvars <-"taxonname4"
mvars  <- c("slope5", "kp5", "kt5", "mvalley", "z2streams")
gw_lo <- melt(gw[c(idvars, mvars)], idvars = idvars, measure.vars = mvars)

ggplot(gw_lo, aes(x = taxonname4, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  coord_flip()

```

# Results

## Hardened Map

```{r harden map}

fd <- "D:/geodata/project_data/R11-FIN/glynwood/"
fp <- paste0(fd, "batch/test_hard/w001001.adf")
r <- raster(fp)
names(r) <- "harden"
plot(r)
```

## Confusion matrix of the initial results

```{r confusion1}

test <- as.data.frame(extract(r, as(gw_sf, "Spatial"), sp = TRUE))

cm_neil <- confusionMatrix(test$erocl_sie, test$erocl)
cm_neil$table
round(cm_neil$overall, 2)

```


## Confusion matrix for the new results

The overall the accuracy of the model is relatively low (~45%), but the class-wise accuracy of the more frequenct classes is ~70%. In general however, the misclassified observations tend to labeled as similar soils. So overall the interpretative accuracy maybe higher. Another point to note is that this landscape is relatively flat. Past studies have found flat landscapes difficult to model. While the current results are low, within this flat landscape, they maybe might be considered respectable.

```{r confusion2}

lv <- c("Blount", "Glynwood-slight", "Glynwood-severe", "Mississinewa")
test2 <- within(test, {
  harden2    = factor(harden, levels = 1:4, labels = lv)
  taxonname3 = factor(taxonname3, levels = lv)
  })

cm_me <- confusionMatrix(test2$harden2, test2$taxonname3)
cm_me$table
round(cm_me$overall, 2)

```

# Conclusions

Using the intersection between the site coordinates and spatial layers to estimate the fuzzy membership parameters seemed to be an improvement over the initial model of erosion classes. This approach is in essence a form of case-based reasoning. Also worth nothing is the relatively coarse resolution of this new new model (10 and 30-meters) vs the initial model (5-meters). Presumable this model could be further improved by increasing the horizontal resolution of the DEM.
